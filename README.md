# Bonzomatic-Shaders
This is a collection of shaders made with and compatible with Bonzomatic (https://github.com/Gargaj/Bonzomatic)

## How to view
Easiest way to view these is to install and run Bonzomatic. Run Bonzomatic in each shader's folder to view the shader.
Some of them react to sounds so be sure to choose the correct audio input for the FFT.
