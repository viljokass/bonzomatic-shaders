# Bonzomatic-Shaders
This is a collection of shaders made with and compatible with Bonzomatic (https://github.com/Gargaj/Bonzomatic)

## How to view
Easiest way to view these is to install and run Bonzomatic. In the Bonzomatic folder, there should be a file called shader.glsl. Replace that file with any shader.glsl-file found here and you should be good to go.
